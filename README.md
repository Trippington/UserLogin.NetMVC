# UserLogin.NetMVC
ASP.NET MVC Login view that checks a database for username and password

This project is currently just for validating user login data inside a database.

The database values have been inserted directly in the database via SQL statements.

A registration feature will be added in the future which will allow users to create a new account inside the webpage and their username and password will be saved to the database.

Login success/failure views are not included in this code.
